# Deep Learning on Sign Language MNIST

In this project, several dense neural network models were developed with an aim of creating the most optimal model that can accurately identify ASL letters using the [Sign Language MNIST](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datamunge/sign-language-mnist) dataset from Kaggle.
